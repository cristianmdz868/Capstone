My project includes a user-friendly client dashboard designed specifically for managing automotive-related tasks in capstone projects. This dashboard empowers clients to efficiently organize their vehicles and appointments, enhancing their overall project experience.

One of the key features is the ability for clients to add new vehicles to their account. This feature enables clients to maintain a comprehensive record of their automotive assets, facilitating discussions with advisors regarding project progress, updates, or any maintenance tasks related to their vehicles.

Additionally, the appointment scheduling functionality streamlines the process of arranging meetings with advisors. Clients can conveniently select preferred date and receive prompt confirmation notifications. This ensures seamless communication and collaboration between clients and advisors throughout the website.

Moreover, the dashboard allows clients to easily reschedule appointments with their advisors as needed. This flexibility accommodates changes in schedules and commitments, ensuring that clients can receive valuable guidance and support without disruptions.

The quick assignment button is a valuable feature, providing a fast and efficient way for advisors to connect clients with technicians, ensuring prompt service delivery. Additionally, the quick appointment ID reference serves as a helpful tool for advisors to conduct further verification when needed, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of appointments.

Another crucial service is the ability to search for clients using various criteria such as first name, last name, or phone number. This functionality ensures that advisors can easily locate specific clients, especially in cases where multiple clients may share similar names. If a client profile is not found, the advisor is promptly notified with a red screen, alerting them to take necessary action or follow up accordingly.

The option for advisors to seamlessly create a profile for clients when a profile is not found is a valuable addition, ensuring a smooth and efficient process. Incorporating features like a salted and encrypted password for added security enhances the protection of client information, which is crucial for maintaining trust and compliance with data security standards.

Once the advisor creates the profile, they can easily access it through the profile tab and proceed to make appointments using the provided information. This streamlined approach not only saves time but also ensures accuracy in appointment scheduling, improving the overall client experience.

Additionally, the ability for advisors to monitor the progress of appointments for the current day provides valuable feedback on timelines and helps identify any delays or issues that may arise. This real-time visibility into appointment status allows advisors to proactively address any concerns and maintain efficient workflow management.
